            let age1 = 85,

            // If we log now, the value we get is : 85, 85.

            // So for strings, numbers and booleans, the second values was a copy and so any change in it,
            // wouldn't affect the original and vice-versa.

            // Let's say we have an array
            const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];
            // and we want to make a copy of it.
            // var team = players;
            // console.log(players, team);
            // You might think we can just do something like this:
            // team[2] = "Mark";
            // but this will affect both the arrays as team acts as a reference
            // for the players array and not as a copy.
            console.log(team, players);

            // So as to avoid this mistake,
            // one way we can create a copy is using the .slice() function.
            // Now if we were to change the value in team2 array, it wouldn't
            // effect the original players array.
            var team2 = players.slice();

            // or create a new array and concat the old one in
            var team3 = [].concat(players);
            // or use the new ES6 Spread
            const team4 = [...players];
            // or use Array.from() method.
            var team5 = Array.from(players);
            // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
            // with Objects
            const person = {
                name: "Wes Bos",
                age: 80,
            };

            // and think we make a copy:
            // const captain = person;
            // captain.number = 99;
            // how do we take a copy instead?
            const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
